# Introduction to Polygon ID Wallet SDK

## Polygon ID Wallet App
The Polygon ID wallet is an open-source app that lets a user authenticate his/her identity via Polygon Verify (a claim issuer website), and retrieve a set of claims from this issuer. The claims are stored in user's wallet and can be later presented to a Verifier in the form of zero-knowledge proofs. A Verifier, after scrutinizing the authenticity of the proof provided, renders a claim "verified".

## Polygon ID Wallet SDK
The implementation of the Polygon ID Wallet app has been achieved through its Wallet SDK (Software Development Kit). This SDK or the devkit provides the necessary set of tools, libraries, references, code samples, and documentation required to built the platform-specific Polygon ID app. This wallet SDK is a pre-built solution that lets the intergators (users) use the wallet app without the need to write the code from scartch and customising it as per their requirements. The integrators can either use our app directly or create an app of their own based on the framework provided by our SDK solution.
